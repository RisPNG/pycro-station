> Test Macro One — select files and run a demo flow.

This is a sample Pycro used to validate the Hub grid, requirement checks, and in-tab launching. The UI shows a Select Files button with a list of chosen files and a Run button that currently does nothing.

Feel free to edit this file to see live updates in the Hub and the macro tab.
