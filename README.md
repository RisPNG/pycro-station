# Pycro Station
The one stop center to store, collaborate, and launch Pycros!

Pycro is a combination of Python and Macro. The era of locking people down to Windows because of their Excel macro can finally be over!

I know that some businesses runs on a lot of macro, which has made it difficult for them to adapt to better technologies such as streamlining GNU/Linux entirely.

I think this is the right step forward for the future of business automation.

## **History of the Project**
Project automation through Excel macros has been dominating the industry for way too long, we need to move past this in order to modernize as Excel macros are much slower compared to Python that can achieve the same thing. The worst part of it all is that only Windows users are able to use them since it's Excel-exclusive.

As a power user, I've started doing general things Linux-only and gaming mostly on Windows due to all the kernel-level anti-cheat mumbo jumbo that games require nowadays. I do not discriminate, the reality is Windows have a bigger user-base, resulting in more advanced apps you can run, and better support by the community but I personally believe that Linux need to receive the same best kind of treatments that the Windows community have.

This project aims to eliminate one of the many barriers Windows and Linux users have and I hope to see more and more projects like this for the community to continue eliminating these barriers.

Aside from that, even though this project main goal is to replace Excel macros, it has much more potential that what I had aimed it to be due to its modular nature. Users can easily create Python scripts and easily share them to the world without having to worry much about setting it up in a nice UI/UX together with figuring out how to ship them out to normal users that don't know much about programming or setting up Python in their environment just to showcase a simple script.
