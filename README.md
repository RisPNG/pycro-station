# Pycro Station
The one stop center to store, collaborate, and launch Pycros!

Pycro is a combination of Python and Macro. The era of locking people down to Windows because of their Excel macro can finally be over!

I know that some businesses runs on a lot of macro, which has made it difficult for them to adapt to better technologies such as streamlining GNU/Linux entirely.

I think this is the right step forward for the future of business automation.
